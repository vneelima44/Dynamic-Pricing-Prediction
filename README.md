Key Steps and Techniques:
1. Data Preprocessing:
a. Standardization: Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler to normalize data and improve model performance.
b. Categorical Encoding: Converted categorical features into numerical representations using One-Hot Encoding (pd.get_dummies()), which is a standard method for handling categorical variables in machine learning.
2. Model Selection and Training:
Applied Random Forest Regressor to predict optimal pricing. The model was chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships and mixed data types (numerical and categorical).
Trained the model using historical pricing data and a variety of features.

3. Model Evaluation:
Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which helped measure how well the model predicted the optimal prices.
Feature Importance:
Analyzed feature importance to determine which factors most influenced the pricing decisions. Here are the top 5 features that played a significant role in the predictions:


This project highlights my ability to leverage data science for real-world applications, optimizing pricing and providing data-driven strategies for business success.
